I am building a Pokémon gacha pull simulator using C++, where players can pull Pokémon with differing rarities (3-star, 4-star, 5-star) based on set percentages. So far, I've created the basic structure, a small list of Pokémon with set rarities, and the logic for doing the pulling simulator aspect of the program. This current code I have remains in the core function of pulling over and over for Pokémon. Players can keep going until they exit the loop. 

My next step is to continue to add features to the program to enhance the loop of pulling over and over. One idea that I plan to code next is the ability to pull for multiple Pokémon in a single run. Most Gacha games offer the option of single pulls or ten pulls, which will most likely be the way I incorporate the feature. I also plan to add more Pokémon in the form of a CSV file containing all Kanto region Pokémon. It also shows their information (stats, type, and others) that will display alongside that Pokémon you pull. Near the end, I hope to try to incorporate graphics that include the pixel sprites of the Pokémon, but that's going to be a last addition over the core enhancement features. There are many more features listed in report for the initial Final Project proposal assignment, but these seem to be the easiest to incorporate.
